# Income-prediction-using-bayes-algorithm

This is a short project where i use the Naive bayes algorithm in predicting whether peoples income exceeds 50k/yr based on census data.

The variables from census data used are for example: age, workclass, fnlwgt, education, education_num, marital_status, occupation, relationship,
race, sex, capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week, native_country.

I clean and transform the data and then use a Gaussian Naive bayes classifier.
